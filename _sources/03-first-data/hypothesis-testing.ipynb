For instance, if $H_0$ is true and we see differences as large as we observed in our data 10% of the time, should we consider the observed difference significant? What if it were only 5% of the time? How about only 1% of the time? There is no right answer to that question. The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis\n",

For instance if the threshold is 10%, then if there is no actual difference between the groups for the random phenomena being measured, a difference in summary statistics as large as the one observed could still occur as often as 10% of the time. In many scientific fields, a $p$-value threshold of 5% is used.
