    "When a system has some form of memory, we refer to the current value of that memory as the *state* of the system. If that memory cannot be observed, then we call that *hidden state*. Systems with hidden state are different from systems with unknown inputs in that the hidden state can affect more than one output: depending on how the state evolves, it may affect one output, a few outputs, or all outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we have already seen a system with hidden state: the Magician's Coin problem. In this problem, the hidden state is which coin was chosen, and the chosen coin affects all future outputs of the system. Note that although the Magician's Coin does not have both state and input(s), many have both.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I will revisit the Magician's Coin problem to better expose why the observations affect the probabilities of future events in the way they do. This gives us a chance to use Bayes' Rule to explore the probabilities of the hidden state, and it will also give us an opportunity to apply our knowledge about conditional independence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the simple question we started with: **If the coin comes up heads on the first flip, what is the probability that it comes up heads on the second flip?**\n",

We previously argued that every time we see an outcome of heads, we should be more likely to believe that we have the two-headed coin (i.e., the probability that we have the two-headed coin should increase).  Only now do we have the tools to test this hypothesis:"

We have to apply conditional independence to find these. If we know the true state, $F$ or $\\overline{F}$, then information about what happened on the first flip cannot affect the outcome of the second flip.
